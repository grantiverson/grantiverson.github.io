# Cat Clicker!

This project was completed as an exercise for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity.

## How I made this app

I created everything from scratch.
My first instruction was to display a cat image with a line of text that displayed the number of times the image had been clicked.
Then, then I had to make it work for two images.
Finally, I was tasked with creating a menu that selected and displayed one cat image, and the appropriate click counter.
I wrote the app with Object Oriented JavaScript so this app could easily be scaled up to include many more cat images.

## Getting started

In order to run the application:
1. Clone the git project using `$ git clone https://github.com/grantiverson/cat-clicker.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory for the project
3. Open index.html in your favorite browser
